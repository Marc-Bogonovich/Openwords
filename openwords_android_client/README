This is the folder for our Android client code.

Please comply some common programming conventions of Java, such as:

For Android project, we only need to share the "src", "res", "libs"
and probably "assets" folders to our git here.
Please DO NOT commit/push any of your local files, that would sabotage
other people's local configurations.
